# Tech_Interviews_Sorting_Algorithms

Abstract Overview 

- time complexity 
- space complexity 

Sorting Algorithm 
- Bubble Sort 
- Quick Sort 
- Merge Sort 

If time Allows, workshop goes fast: 

- Pass by Reference vs. Pass by Value 
- Abstract data types vs Concrete? maybe touch on this for a second: What is abstract and what is concrete
