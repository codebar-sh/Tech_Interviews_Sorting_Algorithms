# Tech_Interviews_Sorting_Algorithms

Abstract Overview  

Sorting Algorithm 
- Bubble Sort 
    - time complexity 
    - space complexity
    - code the algorithm 

- Quick Sort 
    - time complexity 
    - space complexity
    - code the algorithm 

- Merge Sort 
    - time complexity 
    - space complexity
    - code the algorithm 

If time allows, workshop goes fast: 

To do's 
- organize and add interviews to presentation 
- finish talking point notes
- make presentation cards with talking points
- finish presentation slides 
    - add style and structure (html/css/reveal.js framework)
- build demo (bubble)
- build merge 
- build RSA 
- practice presenting workshop a few times  
- design and emplement slides
