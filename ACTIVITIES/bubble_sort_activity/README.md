Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a particular problem or performing a task. Think about writing down all the steps for making a sandwich. In computer science and mathematics, algorithms are essential solving complex problems efficiently. Computers use the steps to complete tasks.

Sorting algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science, used to arrange the elements of a list or array in a particular order, typically in ascending or descending order. Efficient sorting is crucial in various applications, from organizing data to optimizing search algorithms and database management.

Sorting algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main types: Comparison-based sorting and Non-comparison-based sorting. Bubble sort is a comparison-based algorithm. It's stable but not efficient for large datasets. An algorithm is said to be stable if it preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys or values in the sorted output. In other words, if two elements are equal according to the sorting criteria, their order relative to each other remains the same as it was in the input.

The third type of documentation is for the Project Management of the project.  
Project documentation is a set of online documents comprising key project details, milestones met, targets achieved, changes accommodated, and much more. 
These documents act as a centralized reference point where teams can quickly find the information they need to complete certain tasks, track progress, or check recent updates. 
By consolidating all project information in one place (project repository), the documentation can bring clarity to the project management process.   It helps teams stay on target and improves team focus and productivity.

 ### Space Complexity 


### Conclusion
Some teams may prefer to skip code documentation in order to save time and effort. Remember that this strategy might result in even more significant efforts once the product is in development by a team.  If a partially developed portion of the project is picked up by another developer, re-writing the code just takes additional time you may not have available.  Using a dedicated team approach, you can efficiently and effectively cooperate with your team by transferring the knowledge while development is being completed.

## Now its your turn
This will be your deliverable for the lab time to take what you've learned, explore something unfamiliar and apply it. 

### Step 1 - Select a project for a library or program that interests you, but which you are not familiar with yet.  
Make sure you don't pick NumPy, Pandas, or something you've seen before in another class. If you're a wiz at R, Java, or another language then feel free to use  a library/package from that language. It should be unique to you and something that neither you nor maybe even the instructor have seen before. Remember that nobody wants to read twenty different analyses of the NumPy package.
 
Perform a Google Search on "most interesting Open Source Repositories"   
 OR   
Visit a site like: [A.W.E.S.O.M.O](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo)
which is an extensive list of interesting open source projects written in various languages.
 
### Step 2 - Find examples of the different types of documentation within that library. 
Show external documentation, in-code documentation, README files and explain what is present in the documentation. Note which of the characteristics of good and bad documentation are present in the library you chose. Find examples of at least three of the different characteristics that are present in the documentation and provide evidence of them.

- What's missing from the documentation? Is there something that could be added to help the user understand the library? If you were using the library what would you include? Write or Include at least examples of what you would add to the documentation to improve it.

- Write your own : Remember the flask app you built a few weeks ago. Using what you've learned create some sample documentation for your flask app including documentation in the different styles we've discussed (in-code, readme, external) and be sure to follow the conventions discussed earlier. Include a docstring of both the required routes and the ones that you chose to incorporate into your flask application.

### Step 3 - Create a document (LAB12_REPORT.md) in your lab repository
Create a new file within your lab repository and make sure it covers the items listed below.  You can place any snapshot images in a directory `images` at the top level of your project repository.  The html `<img>` or markdown command `![alt text](path to image)` for accessing the image should use a relative path.

#### Items to cover in Lab Report
1.  Description of the project and sources being reviewed

    * URL of site being reviewed
    * Name of resource
    * Purpose or Vision provided by authors
    * What kind of documentation (plain text, html, markdown, markup, ...)

2. Show an example of documentation (standardized headers, ...) for a source file.
3. Show good examples of comments for a code section and for inline comments within the source.
4. Is there 'bad' documentation?  Show an example.
4. What other documentation does the project provide? Give examples.
5. What kind of testing or testing frameworks are used for the project?
1.  Your summary of the documentation style and contents for the project being reviewed.  
    * Was it good or bad?  
    * What could be changed?  
    * What needs to be added?
    * . . . 

### Step 4  - Add documentation to your Flask Lab
Remember when you coded up those routes for your Flask Lab.  You were creating some code and maybe external data files.   Now you will update your sources in the lab repository with header, function, and in code comments.  You will produce a new readme file called `MY_README.md` that explains what you were doing and how you are doing it in the application code.  Make sure to describe any external files or templates used by the application.
