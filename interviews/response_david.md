3. What questions did you ask in each phase of the process? 

interviewer: assess human skills more than tech skills. 
(introduce self and talk) - communicate and talk about self. more how they answer than what
 - pick 3 to 8 tech questions from resume. if technical details don't naturally emerge. direct follow up question will be asked. 
 - can determine within 2 - 3 questions if they learned it or copied it from the someone else 
 "they have actually learned something... [have they] failed and succeeded" 

Note for presentation: Model a good response and a bad response to talk about yourself to include technical information. How to talk about technical information. What is academic/ professional language. Understand the academic/professional words you use if using them. If not using them, be able to talk about code in a conversation for a long amount of time. 

4. What it looks like when: someone can code, but cannot use tech language, and visa versa (make a chart and highlight what hiring managers want to see)

Interviewee: was being recruited and had skeptics in interview. Know that there will be both: 2 executives didn't know me and derisked myself. 
            remember: if you have gotten to be interviews, you need to de-risk yourself. Limit gamble for employers 
            			Talk about how they learn

   			Follow up question: Do candidates need to use academic terms
						- Response: no - as long as they understand the terms that you are learned 
    						- how deeply have they thought about the terms you are using
