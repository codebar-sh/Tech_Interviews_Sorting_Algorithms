Mark Noonan, interviewing in tech for about 4 years total. I've led interviews on the hiring panel at Cypress.io, and was a hiring manager for the front-end team at Michelin Connected Fleet before that, and helped with hiring at a web dev agency.

What questions did you ask in each phase of the process?

-   Usually the first call is just to establish general alignment on what the position is and if their is mutual interest in continuing

-   I ask a lot about specific things they have been involved with or encountered, and I try to understand their decision making and preferences around what they want to work on

-   I sorta build this off of their resume, instead of asking generic questions

-   In some cases there is also a tech screen which I've done a few different ways. I think a lot of candidates try to "win" the tech screen by completing the task quickly, but that's not what I'm assessing at all - it's how to you approach work, do you have a framework for tackling unfamiliar tasks, asking questions, do you make forward progress using what you do know, and can you talk about and explain code you've written. I really try to lower the stress of tech screens by being up front at the start that it's not about completing the exercise.

What soft skills were assessed during interviewing?

-   This overlaps a lot with strengths. I see a lot of "soft" skills as just core working requirements.

What types of strengths are you looking for in a good candidate?

-   "Grit, game, & growth" which is something I got from a Chris Aquino talk in ATL. Also curiosity and humility, willingness to learn & teach others.

    -   Grit: do you stick with things you find challenging? Have you had to eke out winds in difficult circumstances? Doesn't mean overworking or being a hero, more about maintaining focus when "stuck" and trying enough things to find a solution - including asking the right people for help, docs, debugging, whatever.

    -   Game: how are you with people, how would you approach collaboration with coworkers and advocating for the things think should happen at work? How well do you understand "work" itself?

    -   Growth: do you tend to get promoted at the companies you work at, or otherwise can you show increasing responsibility over time.

    -   Curiosity: There are a lot of ways to show this, but it's incredibly useful as a developer to be curious about things.

    -   Humility: How do you talk about your accomplishments, and your coworkers.

What types of weaknesses do you try to avoid in a candidate?

-   Generally I am not looking to find specific weakness, I'm only looking for strengths. Everybody has some weaknesses. But if a candidate shows certain qualities on their own without me digging, I'm unlikely to recommend them:

    -   They are unkind in the interview and seem like they would not be kind to their coworkers
    -   They can't describe their work as part of an overall system/team

    -   They only tell me things that happened and things they did but not what they learned or how they think about/approach things

    -   They are only interested in problems, not users

-   I'm also kinda trying to see if somebody is just "bad at interviewing", and if I can detect that, I'll try to burst the bubble of formality somehow and get them to open.
