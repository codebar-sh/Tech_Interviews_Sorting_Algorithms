Include slide number, slide content, and talking points

needs: 

- music to play at intro as people are walking in, and for quiet points (ask them if they like it, don't assume)
- burndown at bottom of each slide / as simple as slide number/ total slides at bottom 

1. Welcome (with lively music and low volume)

2. Ice Breaker 

3. Overview/ agenda (remember to keep a burn down/burn up chart at the bottom of each slide)

4. Neruo logical how to learn faster (what they are and why)

4. (a) Standard(s)? make some? 

5. List what viewers will gain: (1) insight into what hiring managers are looking for in a candidate, (2) what to study and (3) how to study it (4) practice studying in the session using sorting algorithms 

6. Why/ problem presentation solves (too much information to figure out how to prepare)

7. Present findings what will be in the tech interview. 
    - Present on each: interviews, books, professors, email to Ishe with skills report... 
    - How to measure your skill level and ask question: how to know what skill level you need to be at the job 
    - important take away: it's about relationships. No one will hire you if you don't have social skills. So, in today's workshop you will practice: how to answer the question: tell me about yourself based the the questions I asked real interviewers and 2. pair programming, the way you will be assess on your social skills or ability to work along side other programmers. You will also learn how to learn independantly using the latest technology: AI and pitfalls developers make when leading too much on AI 

8. Present how to study using tried and true studying practices
    talking points: even though coding is a new field of study being only X years old since the first computer was made, pedegogy is not. How old is pedegogy.... here are practices combining good learning habits to study for your next coding interview using sorting algorithms. 

9. pair coding (info graphic) What it is and how (May need 2 slides: what and how with 2 different infographic)
10. Do's and Don't's of studying with AI infographic chart with 4 squares. green square are what employers are looking for and red are not. What employers are looking for from smart applicants (David interview). 

10. (a) Time break down (30:30 - try a coding algorithm 30 minutes. Then spend 30 minutes coding and commenting solution line by line. Try to code the whole page from memory) - incoporate (5:5) for pair coding experience. relate each part to tried and true pedegogy. and how to set task goal for study sessions 

11. Top Down Programming info graphic 
12. CCI approach to coding interviews 
13. 1 - 2 more interview books? 
14. Interview professors - TO DO <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

15. Neruo logical how to learn faster (how) - do not say this is for the neuro divergents in the room, even though it is 

16. specifically what to prepare (Ishe email) and how to incoporate job and interview prep into your daily routine. Note this is my opinion  

17. I do workshop task 
    - now is the fun part where we get to work as a team to pair code. Please take a minute to say hi to the person/ people next to you, because these are the people you'll be pair coding with 
    - introduce assignments and how they are based on skill level. Base level is best if everyone in the group is a beginner. Move up as you team might have more experience <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    - explain how to pair code using infographic 
    - model how to pair code with someone in the room 

18. We do (Give everyone 3 - 5 minutes to get aquainted with the assignments they choose and get started pair coding 

19. reminde with inforgraphic after 5 minutes how to pair code 

20. You do. (pretty slide, and music if wanted) Set them loose on the you do. Walk rooom. Tech for understanding and application of practices. Answer questions

21. Q&A (get input about questions you have for interviewers and topics ideas for next workshop through an interactive word wall)

22. recap 

23. thank you to contributers 

24. Thank you's and good byes
