                        Welcome everyone to the Tech Interviews with Sorting
                        Algorithms Workshop. I’m Lauren Collins, and I’ll be
                        guiding you through today's session. This workshop is
                        designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of how
                        sorting algorithms play a crucial role in technical
                        interviews and to prepare you for real-world coding
                        challenges. Throughout this session, we’ll explore
                        different sorting techniques and practice implementing
                        them. In addition, we’ll also be introduced to
                        techniques for practicing soft skills, such as
                        communication and problem-solving, which are highly
                        valued by employers.

                        Interviews can be unpredictable. This workshop aims to
                        demystify the tech interview process.

                        Interviews can often feel unpredictable, leaving
                        candidates unsure of what to expect. This workshop is
                        designed to demystify the tech interview process,
                        helping you understand what interviewers are really
                        looking for and how you can best prepare. By the end of
                        this session, you'll have a clearer idea of how to
                        approach technical interviews with confidence. I
                        interviewed several hiring managers to understand what
                        they look for in candidates. This is what they had to
                        say.

                            Mid Level: Demonstrate your technical growth and
                            adaptability.

                        <li>
                            Senior Level: Preparedness and deep knowledge are
                            key. Present at conferences, write articles, and
                            align with current practices.
                        </li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Across all levels, it's crucial to have a public
                        portfolio, whether it's a GitHub repository or a
                        personal blog, as employers are increasingly looking for
                        evidence of practical work. For junior candidates, it's
                        essential to focus on soft skills like communication,
                        teamwork, and problem-solving, which are often more
                        critical than deep technical knowledge at this stage.
                        Mid-level candidates should emphasize their technical
                        growth and adaptability by showcasing how they've
                        learned new technologies or taken on greater
                        responsibilities. For senior-level candidates,
                        preparedness and deep knowledge are key. It's important
                        to position yourself as a thought leader by presenting
                        at conferences or writing technical articles, which can
                        really set you apart. This insight comes from David, a
                        Senior Director in IT, who highlighted the importance of
                        showcasing your work publicly, regardless of your level,
                        as it can open up valuable networking opportunities for
                        your career.

                        starting with a docstring to define inputs and outputs
                        before coding. He advocates for a "top down" programming
                        approach, which involves structuring the solution from a
                        high level before diving into the details. Additionally,
                        Eddie highlights the value of idiomatic programming,
                        using tools like dictionary and list comprehensions to
                        write clean and efficient code. He also supports the
                        idea of trying to solve problems with a top-down
                        programming approach first and, then using AI to learn

                            to write and rewrite code from memory generated by
                            AI.

                        It's importance of not just copying code but truly
                        understanding it, especially when dealing with
                        challenging subjects like algorithms and data
                        structures. I suggest using AI as a tool to create
                        self-quizzes, which can help reinforce knowledge and
                        identify areas that need more focus. I recommend
                        leveraging AI to develop customized study plans,
                        particularly for efficient learning within a set
                        timeframe. Coders need a deep understanding of topics to
                        perform well in interviews, where candidates must
                        confidently explain concepts. Active recall is a
                        powerful technique for solidifying knowledge. All coders
                        should practice writing code from memory to enhance
                        retention.

                            When learning a new technology, it's important to
                            start with something simple like a "Hello World"
                            tutorial, which provides a quick win and a basic
                            understanding of the setup. Next, finding a
                            comprehensive resource, such as a book or a
                            well-structured online course, can help build a
                            solid foundation. Free resources are particularly
                            valuable and often sufficient. Finally, applying the
                            Pareto Principle can accelerate learning—focus on
                            mastering the essential 20% of the technology that
                            will deliver 80% of the benefits. This approach
                            allows for quicker application and understanding,
                            making you more productive with the new technology
                            in a shorter amount of time.
