					<h1>The Problem with Interviews</h1>
				</section>

				<!-- 6. Expectations based on level 
				   I interviewed X hiring managers to know what they are looking for in a candidate.
				 	 This is what they had to say: 
						- All skill levels: 
 						- It's important to work in pubic so employers can see your work. 
						- Junior level: soft skills are important
				 		- Mid level:
						- Senior level: preparedness is key. you might know some people who got your 
				 						foot in the door, but there will be people you need to persued to your abilities,
				 						so come ready to impress with topic to discuss/prepared. 
				 						Working in public is how you can get your foot in the door even at senior levels
   										levels too (present at comferences, write articles, etc.) -->
				
				<!-- - Game: how are you with people, how would you approach collaboration with coworkers and advocating for the things think should happen at work? How well do you understand "work" itself?
				- Growth: do you tend to get promoted at the companies you work at, or otherwise can you show increasing responsibility over time.					   
				- Curiosity: There are a lot of ways to show this, but it's incredibly useful as a developer to be curious about things.					   
				- Humility: How do you talk about your accomplishments, and your coworkers. -->

					pick study techniques you remember worked for you in school
				 	All interviewers said the same thing: a degree is not required.
				 	In my discussion with academic advisors, I found that the following courses are what employers are looking for: -->

				 <!-- 9. How to study using AI (relate to pedegoty they have heard of): 
				 	  tell AI to quiz me on "topic", give AI the content to study 
				    and say: "help me study." Don't replace AI for your understanding. 
				    You should understand the topics and be able to discuss the topics 
				    at the level of understanding you say you are  you say you know in 
				    an interview
				    Employers are not looking for you to plug in a problem into AI. 
				    To use AI in a professional way, consider using it to quiz you on a topic you 
				    say you know.  -->

					<h1>Study Tips</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Use AI to quiz you on a topic</li>
						<li>Make a plan with AI. Ex: make a study plan to learn python in 5 hours</li>
